**Electroencephalography interpretation by Artificial Intelligence**


**Background**


Substantial algorithmic advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the past five years have been driven largely by a specific class of models known as deep neural networks (DNN). DNNs are computational models consisting of multiple processing layers, with each layer being able to learn increasingly abstract, higher-level representations of the input data relevant to perform specific tasks. They have dramatically improved the state of the art in speech recognition (Amodei 2016), image recognition (He 2015), strategy games such as Go (Silver 2016), and in medical applications (Gulshan 2016, Esteva 2017). The ability of DNNs to recognize patterns and learn useful features from raw input data without requiring extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering or handcrafted rules makes them particularly well suited to interpret electroencephalography (EEG) data. Furthermore, since DNN performance tends to increase as the amount of training data increases, this approach is well positioned to take advantage of the widespread digitization of EEG data and especially the wealth of information collected at Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia (INNN).

**Significance**


EEG interpretation through AI could potentially improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on EEG. Moreover, this methodology could serve as a non-invasive method for early diagnosis on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's.
