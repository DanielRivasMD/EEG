### Project EEG ideas

1. General approach:
	- **Background**: there is a variety of studies combining EEG and AI that are succesful, however sample sizes are most often limited [REFERENCES]
	- **Goal**: generic EEG [interpretation | prediction]? AI tool
	- **Methodology**: large sample of most abundant EEG in a variety of diseases
	- **Impact**: general use for the medical community, not only neurologists



2. Specific approach:
	- **Background**: EEG is an essential in the diagnosis and follow up of some diseases, e.g. epilepsy
	- **Goal**: disease specific EEG [interpretation | prediction]? AI tool
	- **Methodology**: small sample defined by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria
	- **Impact**: restricted to a specific condition
	- **Examples**:
		- Classification of epilepsy types?
		- Diagnosis of epileptic epidose during post-ictal period?
