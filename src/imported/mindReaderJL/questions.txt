NN
difference between autoencoder & variational autoencoder
fully connected neural network
autoencoder error


Design
C++Wrapper


C++
access to global variables?
declarations within class
vector memory allocation


HMM
why print fraction frames?
how can we use the state?


EEG
how much correlation is expected on contralateral electrodes?
how much overlap is there among different waves?
how much influence is there with different manoeuvres during EEG recording, e.g. eyes opening?
